Ahh　今疲れています！
Haha don't worry, I'm not gonna go off in Japanese either.
Although I was considering making two more jupyter notebooks like this one
so that I can practice writing
in French and Japanese cuz I def need the practice.
But yeah another productive day under my belt!
I guess I should've been taking it easy since it's Christmas and all
but why stop when I have nothing better to do.
Today was actually great for me because I got to practice web scraping with BeautifulSoup
and I must say it was much easier than I thought it would be.
I made a good amount of progress in learning BeautifulSoup.
I felt pretty proud of myself because I was able to make a pretty decent dataset with it.
My next steps are using natural language processing to help build a recommender system.
Two areas of data science that I'm a verified noob but I'll manage something eventually.
何とかなる！
