Uhh I guess I had some technical difficulties with Jupyter notebook just now.
Idk why I need to keep pip installing modules I should already have but I digress.
Today wasn't too bad. I wasn't as productive as I was for the past couple of days
but that's fine cuz I gave myself time to relax and have a bit of fun so it's all good.
I did, however manage to pick up from where I left off with Jose Portilla's DS Udemy course.
I can't say that I remember everything that I learned before I took a hiatus on it 
but that's what review is for right?
I learned more about Recommender Systems and Natural Language Processing
and NLP seems like a pretty cool concept in spite of how relatively abstract it seems.
I'm still thinking about how to apply what I learned to the anime DS project 
that I'm thinking about and I will say that I think it'll be a cool project to explore 
with these concepts in mind.
I guess going in to this I would consider this my 3rd day of 66 days of Data Science if I was ever really apart of it to begin with...
