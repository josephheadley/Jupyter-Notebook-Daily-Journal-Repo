Wow ok looks like it's finally working! Hello world! 
This is my first time using Jupyter Notebook to write a journal. 
Better yet my first time trying to journal in a while... 
I guess I'm just a bit surprised that this is working that I'm not sure what to write about.
I guess one thing on my mind is that disregarding my finances right now I think things are starting to look up for me. 
For the first time since starting College I feel like I have a real handle on my life. 
It always felt like I was skirting by with the minimum amount of effort and not thinking in advance for what my future would look like and whether Physics was something I felt comfortable doing. 
But I think I've found what I love in Data Science and hopefully in the process of learning everything I can about the field I'll feel confident enough to call myself a full-fledged Data Scientist!
