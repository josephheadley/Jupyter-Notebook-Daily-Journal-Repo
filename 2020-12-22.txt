Wow ok looks like it's finally working! Hello world! This is my first time using Jupyter Notebook to write a journal. Better yet my first time trying to journal in a while... I guess I'm just a bit surprised that this is working that I'm not sure what to write about. I guess one thing on my mind is that disregarding my finances right now I think things are starting to look up for me. For the first time since starting Williams I feel like I have a real handle on my life. It always felt like I was skirting by with the minimum amount of effort and not thinking in advance for what my future would look like and whether Physics was something I felt comfortable doing.
