Hello again! Back for another installment of "On That Grind!" Jk jk.
Today was another pretty good day for me.
I was able to organize my room to what I would consider almost perfectly organized.
The TV has a nice little porch to rest on that's higher than air mattress level so that's good!
As for my 4th day of Data Science, I watched a bit more of Jose Portilla's videos on Deep Learning.
I finally finished the theory videos and started watching videos that deal with actual code,
but the first deep learning coding video felt more like ML review than anything else.
I guess things will start to ramp in later videos then.
Other than that I watched a couple of tutorial videos on cython as way to improve performance speed.
I think it would be really cool to be able to apply that to my future projects 
but I think I'm still a little too wet behind the ears to try it yet.
Although thinking back on the deep learning videos that I watched,
I got a few ideas on directions to take my anime Data Science project 
that I wrote down on, you guessed it, a flashcard
so stay tuned for how that pans out.
This is Joey signing off!s
