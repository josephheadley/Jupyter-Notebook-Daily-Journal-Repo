Oh mon Dieu! J'ai appris beaucoup aujourd'hui!
Haha lemme stop with the francais before I start overthinking my words.
But today was really a big step for me especially after coming from the unproductivity that was yesterday.
I hunkered down and watched helpful tutorial videos about 
web scraping with beautifulsoup4, natural language processing, and regular expressions.
I also got rid of a lot of my phone's Google Chrome tabs which is def a plus!
I learned those to improve as a Data Scientist ofc,
but I also thought regex and web scraping would be pretty useful for my current internship project.
I think a major part of me making this kind of progress was realizing
that I shouldn't allow myself to feel overwhelmed 
by all of the things that I feel I should know as a Data Scientist.
There's a lot I'll have to learn and I'll never stop learning,
which means I have a good amount of time to keep learning and growing.
I don't have to be a seasoned Data Scientist just because 
that's what it seems like Data Science jobs require.
I can just be unapologetically me rough around the edges and all.
Soon enough I'll be the polished gemstone I want myself to be.
